# LINFO1252_projet1

## Description
Project conducted in the context of the `LINFO1252 Syst√®mes informatiques` course.
The idea is to evaluate and discuss the performance of multithreads applications that use synchronization primitives.

In that regard, the three considered applications are:
- the problem of the philosopher ;
- the problem of readers/writers ;
- the problem of producers/consumers.

## Usage
A script, `/src/test_scripts/launch_tests.sh`. allows to compile the `.c` code and launch tests. This will produce graphs on the performance of the code.
It can be run directly using this command:
```shell
bash launch_tests.sh
```
